# Blackjack
simple python blackjack single player vs dealer

To begin you'll need some kind of IDE like vscode, pycharm etc.
To begin you can open this file in whatever software you're using and simply run it in the terminal.

The rules are standard blackjack rules and follow the same objectives:
  -Try to make 21 or get as close as possible without exceeding it
  -Aces can count for 1 or 11 depending on your score 
  -cards are randomized and shuffled fresh everytime the program is ran
  -The program does deviate in that players and dealers start off with 1 card instead of 2
  - hitting is the action of drawing a card to add to your hand when the prompt asks for your action you can type h or hit to gain a card
  - standing is the action of ending your turn and revealing the dealers cards when the prompt asks for your actuin you can type s or stand to end your turn
  - if player and dealer have the same score it ends in a tie


Future updates:
  - allow multiple rounds and prompt player to end after each round
  - give players an startign capital and implement betting
  - personal bests
  - visuals
